# Udacity-Explore-Bikeshare-Data
## Overview
This project was my fourth assignment with Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree where I learned to program with R. I analyzed bike rental data collected from
three different cities: New York, Washington D.C., and Chicago. Each table contained information about the start time, end time, trip duration, start
station, end station, and user type. The tables New York and Chicago also contain data on the user's birth year and gender. I analyzed the data based on
three questions, two that were provided by the assignment and one that I asked on my own.

### Software Used
- Jupyter Notebooks
- R
- ggplot2

### Files Used
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
- chicago.csv

### Questions
1. What are the earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)?
2. What is the average travel time for users in different cities?
3. What are the counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)?
